# SampleERP

This project is a demonstration of using JavaFx with JDBC. The project contains adding users to access the system, adding business partners
that can be either a customer or supplier with their information, and also adding products that will have a business partner reference.


# Getting Started


The build tool used is Maven, also the MySql is used, therefore you need to install the latest version of Connector/J.
If you use Maven then you can add the following dependency [mysql-connector-java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.12), for
interacting with the database.
You need to also download [mySql WorkBench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to be able to connect to the server and visualize the tables.

Therefore, create a new database in mySql WorkBench and call it `erp` then you can clone the project and run it.
